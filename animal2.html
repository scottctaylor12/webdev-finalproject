		<p style="font-size: 18pt;">Cat Ba Langurs live in limestone rich areas in the Karst Forest. Many times, the monkeys will stay in caves to keep away from the threating weather, but only stay for about two nights before leaving and going to the next one. Then they proceed to find another cave for feeding and resting.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 18pt;">Both the males and females contain near identical color except the the females will have a white patch of hair. However, infants are more of a bright orange and begin to develop more of an adult color at 4 months.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 18pt;">The Cat Ba monkeys are located on the island of Cat Ba located just off shore of Vietnam. There is no signs that they left the island and made it to mainland.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 18pt;">A majority of the Cat Ba Langur's day is spent resting and forging. They mostly eat leaves, flowers, bark, and various fruits. Most of the fruit that is consumed has a very high concentration of fibre and tannic that would be poisonous to other animals and humans.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 18pt;">This species is considered one of the most critically endangered species in the world due to its small population size and limited range. There are only about 60 monkeys in existence. In 1960 there were approximately 2,800, but in 2000 ir dropped to a mere 53 due to the high amount of poaching that was going on.</p>
