		<p>The Tonkin Snub-nosed Monkey is found primarily in the subtropical lowland broadleaf forest on steep limestone hills. The monkey is exclusively arboreal, meaning it lives in trees. At one point they were thought to be extinct, but in 1989 they were rediscovered in the Tuyen Quang and Bac Thai Provinces.</p>
		<p> The Tonkin Snub-nosed Monkey weighs between eighteen and thirty-two pounds. Their diet primarily consists of leaves, bamboo, and various fruits. The social group typically consists of one male along with several females, and young animals.</p>
		<p>The decline in this species is mostly because of the loss of habitat and hunting. The military had taken down a majority of the land for bases, so by 1986 more than 70% of their original habitat had been lost.</p>
